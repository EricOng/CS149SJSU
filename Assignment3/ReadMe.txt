Here's how I see this being structured:
  1. Source files in ./src/ directory.
     Feel free to use subdirectories for organization.
  2. Executable(s) in ./bin/
  3. Project report file(s) in ./report/

You can use the 'compileAndRun.sh' script to build and run the project
succintly.  Passing a command-line argument to the script will also
pass that same argument to the 'tickets.out' program when it runs.
